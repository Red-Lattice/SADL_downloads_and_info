<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
    To download an adventure, find a url that points to it on the sporepedia, and drop it into the program.<br>
    This will create a folder with a bunch of png files that once dragged into the game, loads the creations so that you can play it.<br><br>
    <b>Make sure to drag in the adventure png LAST</b> - otherwise you may end up running into issues with the game not recognizing that all of the creations are downloaded.<br>
    <br><br>
    It's important to note that the link when you're using the search feature on the sporepedia does not contain any information about the adventure and cannot be used to download it.<br>
    In this case, use the adventure's ID, a unique 12 digit number usually starting with 50 which can be found by saving the png. The png's name will be the ID.<br>
    <br>

<img src="DownloadByID.png" alt="Find the adventure in the sporepedia search, right click to save the image, copy the number from the name, and use that as the input ID."></img>
